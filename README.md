Repository for the second assignment in Computational Machine Learning, where we had to use bagging and boosting models to predict the position of football players based on their statistics.  

Please do notice that the focus of this project was not on overall architecture of the model but rather on EDA and predictive capacity of the model.

The model is based on a two-staged prediction where we first predicted players' general position (goalkeeper, defender, midfielder or attacker) and afterwards we predicted the specific position within those first classifications.

Tailored the project to suit a Kaggle competition format (with people from within the class only).
